I am a graduate student from the School of Computer and Information Engineering, Nanning Normal University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests include natural language processing, causal reasoning, fact verification, and deep learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Hao Zhang, from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and am currently working as a visiting student.

You can contact me via email at: zhaojianbo@email.nnnu.edu.cn.
